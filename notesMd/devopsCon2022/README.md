# Detailed Talk Notes from DevOps Talks Conference, Sydney, Australia, 2022

These are Mitch's fairly detailed talk notes. You're welcome to read them, or add to them.

These detailed notes have two purposes:

1. I'm using them to create actually useful summaries for general consumption (potentially in comic form).
2. We can be referred back to them (and use CTRL+F on them) we want to jog our memory of a particular moment at the conference.

Slides are available at https://devops.talksplus.com/2022_Sydney/agenda.html, which should be complementary.

Please note that these notes are only my attempt to represent the views of the speakers. Hence:

1. I will have gotten things wrong and misinterpreted things on occasion; in the case that the notes say incorrect things, the speakers should be given the benefit of the doubt;
2. Credit for the meaningful content of these notes goes to the speakers, not to me.
