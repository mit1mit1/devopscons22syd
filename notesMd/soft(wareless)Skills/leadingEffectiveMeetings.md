# Leading effective meetings

## Four steps

We can break down the task of running a meeting into four steps:

1. Planning
   - Make sure you figure out the right people to invite - missing important people can mean the whole meaning is wasted, bringing extras is wasting their time;
   - Make sure everything is set up so you don't waste time during the meeting;

2. Opening
   - Make some things explicit so everyone is on the same page:
     - Purpose of the meeting and what the outcome should be;
     - A preview of the meeting content;
     - The process the meeting will follow;

3. Running
    - Guide the process; Push everyone's thinking; Monitor their reactions
    - Having a parking lot is very helpful

4. Closing
   - Summarise the meeting
   - Make the next steps explicit, as well as who has responsibility for each of these;
   - Schedule follow-up meetings if necessary

## Seven principles

1. If in doubt don't meet!
2. Be explicit about the topics in advance and adjust if necessary
3. Stick to the agreed purpose and process
4. Provide very clear roles for participants (especially who is here to make decisions). Some usual roles include:
   - Chairperson (lead discussion, keep everyone on track, provide context at start and summary at end);
   - Decision maker (other people have input, this person has authority)
   - Subject matter expert (provides insights)
   - Timekeeper (keep attendees via the chair accountable to timeframe requirements)
   - Action keeper (make sure essential information is captured, especially the outcomes of the meeting and who is doing them)
5. No spectators or tourists; if someone doesn't need to make decisions, they can probably just be informed about it later.
6. Reduce reading through of documents (that is better done solo), instead focus on discussion
7. Make the decided tasks actually happen!

## Capturing outcomes

If you want to effectively capture outcomes, aim for maximum clarity:
 - Exactly What (EW);
 - By Exactly Who (BEW);
 - By Exactly When (BEW);

The aim of this is to make sure everyone has shared and realistic expectations. It should provide an opportunity for pushback (Bob asks if Alice is planning to finish a particular task by Tuesday, Alice can respond that she will instead do a slightly different task by Wednesday).

## Side notes

Confluence and Google Docs each have nice ways of adding meeting notes. It's important to keep track of the outcomes and next steps of meetings, this can help.
