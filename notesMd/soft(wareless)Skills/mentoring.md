# On Mentoring

## What's the value?

Mentoring holds value for both the mentor and mentee. Each of you should expand your network, each of you should learn from each other's experience (and from the experience of mentoring itself), and hopefully, each of you will enjoy the time together.

It doesn't have to be a senior managing a junior. It doesn't have to be a long term thing. It can be to grow at a broad skill, or a really precise one.

And hopefully, if you're helping each other grow and helping each other network, that'll be good for your company too.

## Getting started

Clarity is good. Try and set:

1. A clear goal/objective.
2. Well-defined times and ways to communicate/meet.
3. Roles - what each of you will prepare for the meetings, etc.
4. An agreement on how you'll treat each other
  - in particular, it's good to agree not to break confidentiality, both of yourselves and others (obviously with the exception of if someone needs urgent help).


## Tips and tricks

Open ended questions are good. In particular reflecting questions back to the mentee with a bit of directional prodding is good.

Try and be aware of how the mentee is feeling, and if helpful, ask how they're going.

It's wise to avoid "assigning homework" - instead, ask the mentee if they have particular things they want to work on, and help them refine them if necessary.

Keep a feedback loop open - you want to make sure the mentoring is helpful for both of you.

Try and guide both yourself and your mentee into a communication level where you're sharing everything important without too much fluff.
