# Time Management

We all have 24 hours a day - what you do with it varies. Hence, what matters is managing the things you fill it with.

Goal: get things done.

Prioritization is required to achieve that.

Consider the effort/outcome ratio to achieve that.

## Activity types

Effort driven activities such as digging a hole can be completed faster with more effort, albeit with an efficiency decay as more effort is put in - 30 people digging will get in each other's way.

Fixed duration activities can't be completed faster no matter how hard you try or how many people help - for example, drying paint. Or maybe it is a one man job - two people can't really stir flour for the same cake.

## Productivity vs efficiency

Being productive means we do more things: producing 1000 units vs. 1100 units.

Efficiency is about accuracy and precision, reducing wastage.

## Assessment of a task

Ask:
- How valuable is the task to the organization?
- Are you required to do the task?
- How much personal value does the task offer to you?
- Can you delegate the task?

## Prioritization

Time management is self-discipline. It is your time, you can do what you want. Things can distract and you may need to remove them, ignore them, or reschedule them if they are not important at the time.

Example of distractions:
- Internet;
- Office chit-chat;
- Ad hoc meetings;
- Social interactions;

Self discipline is essential.

To prioritize:

1. Define your work. Get a backlog of what you need to accomplish, break it up by the days of the week, and make sure you capture the actions you need to complete.

2. Decide what is urgent or important. See who is affected by the work - how many teams, and how badly? Does something else depend on this work? What's the value of completing the work?

The Eisenhower decision matrix is one way of deciding what to do when.

3. Prioritize by required effort. Within a square of the matrix, you can start with the task that takes the most effort to get it out of the way, then move on to the smaller ones.

4. Review the results. Could you complete everything on time? Why or why not? What worked and what didn't? What would you differently?

5. Balance forward. Whatever you can't complete today, move to tomorrow and repeat the prioritization. Identify the cause of procrastination - fear, doubt, dread - and take action on them.


# Strategies for time management

## Pareto principle

80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Pick the top two most important of your tasks.

## Write tomorrow's list today

Know what to do.

Don't confuse quality with quantity.

Have 3 to 5 items in a day.

Start with just the number one item.

## Use more than one list

Might be helpful to have a separate list for daily items, weekly items, monthly items. Update all of them at the end of the day.

## Winning the to-do list

How do I really become most effective?

- Tackle one big thing before lunch to give yourself a sense of achievement while you are fresh.
- Highlight what's been done.
- Break down the big stuff. 


## Be unavailable

- Hide yourself in the communications software (Slack, WhatsApp, etc., ...).
- Find an empty meeting room.
- Schedule unavailability for a couple of hours.

## Pomodoro Technique

- Pomodoro is a kitchen timer
- Break work into 25 minutes, take a short break and go again
- This timeboxes your day

Pomodoro steps:
- Choose the task;
- Do the work
- End the work after 25 minutes
- After each of the first three iterations, take a longer break

## 1-3-5 technique

- One big thing (before lunch)
- Three medium things (later)
- Five little things (by the end of the day)

"If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the big one first" - Albert Einstein

## Brook's Law

Sometimes adding more people to a late software project makes the project later.

There are exceptions. If the people you add are qualified, or if you add them early, you have a better chance of success.

## Methods to create duration estimates

- Rough order of magnitude
- Analogous estimating
- Parametric estimating
