# Structuring Communication

## Thinking about your audience

### Three magic questions

1. Where are they now?
    - What are they feeling?
    - What do they know?
    - What don't they know?

2. Where do you want them to be?

3. How can I get them there?

A good example of communication that has thought through these questions is [Sealy's Mattress Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjyZhE9rYCw).

A bad example is a rant about everyone's availabilities in the middle of which is the time that does work.


## Learn how to structure your message using the pyramid principle

### Using a top down structure

To answer a question using a pyramid top-down structure:
- Start with the main point (a synthesis, not a summary);
  - A summary is a shorted list of facts, but still contains more than one point (look out for an 'and');
  - A synthesis is boiled down to a single point. To reach this, one method is to keep asking 'so what' until you get to a common answer.
- Then provide key insights;
- And then back each of those up with detail grouped in a logical way.


A Q&A dialogue is another way to apply the pyramid principle - start with that synthesis, and then delve into each level as an answer to a question.

### From structure to storyline

The pyramid structure we looked at above can easily be turned into a narrative to make it even easier to digest as a listener.
