# Detailed Talk Notes from DevOps Talks Conference, Sydney, Australia, 2022

These are Mitch's fairly detailed talk notes. You're welcome to read them, or add to them.

These detailed notes have two purposes:

1. I'm using them to create actually useful summaries for general consumption (potentially in comic form).
2. We can be referred back to them (and use CTRL+F on them) we want to jog our memory of a particular moment at the conference.
