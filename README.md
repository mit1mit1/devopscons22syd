# software-dev-resources

This repo is a collection of information and ideas I've picked up from various places, and also a comic of some of those ideas set up with Vite.

You can view the comic at [mit1mit1.github.io/software-dev-resources](https://mit1mit1.github.io/software-dev-resources/index.html).

The rest of the un-comicified notes are all in [https://github.com/mit1mit1/software-dev-resources/tree/main/notesMd](./notesMd).
