# A multi-cloud platform for end to end open source data architectures - Mark Lynch, Strategic Account Executive of Aiven

We're invested, capitalist-serious about open source. We want you to be able to build end-to-end open source architecture on a single platform.

Open source used look a bit silly, a rear view mirror thing. Would you fly a plane that is open source? Maybe most wouldn't have a few years ago, but now - yeah, probably.

There's still steps that need to be taken around managing it. Some effort is still required for maintenance and support.

9/10 public clouds are on Linux, 5/10 relational databases are built on Open Source.

We want to make data infrastructure easy to consume and use, without a weekend all-nighter to set it up.

Aiven for redis, Kafka, Cassandra, flink, M3, opensearch, clickhouse, postgres, grafana, MySQL - crucially, all under one roof. Aiven takes care of the operations - observability, keeping availability up, security. Their team does data really well.

There's no hidden costs, complete transparency in the price (no "and, and, and, ...")

We're not talking about managing one product - you can do the whole lot on the same platform.
E.g. in one customer's case, they wanted added confidence so they created a read replicate of their Google cloud database in AWS - at the click of a button.

According to software advice, Aiven's reviews are actually very good (https://www.softwareadvice.com/database-management-systems/aiven-postgresql-profile/reviews/).

You can come in and do your terraform in Aiven if you want to.

There's great organisations providing Kafka as a service, etc. But if we were to manage something like our customer, a FinTech that wanted google cloud and also AWS (and had a bunch of other requirements) - if you want to wrap all that together with terraform with a bunch of open source stuff you've bundled together yourself, it will be a bit complex. Different terraform providers, etc. will cause issues. Aiven's "one platform, one terraform provider" helps immensely.

They're also trying to build communities. And they'll give start ups with Cluster up to 100,000 dollars of credits.
