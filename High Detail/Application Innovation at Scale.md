# Application Innovation at Scale - Andreas Spanner, Chief Architect at Red Hat

I have a podcast - "A Spanner in the Works". You can also follow me on linkedin if you want. I'm German, not funny, and not smart.

DevOps is a verb. Enterprises have tried to apply the goodness of devops but it hasn't occurred the way they wanted.

"You need to be this tall to do microservices". To do microservices well, you need self-service, on demand infrastructure, but also you need to re-organise to a devops organisation.

Then you need some tools and such.

Sometimes, DevOps doesn't work - and it wasn't Voldemort that made it fail.

We will focus today on certain points from the DevOps research, to try and figure out what is needed to make it succeed.

## 1. Cloud Infrastructure.

We have a bunch of cloud deployment options. We need a consistency of experience at scale.

A lot of organisations are moving towards hybrid cloud/multi-cloud. Organisations by 2023 expect to be using at least 10 clouds. However, only 10% have strategies for meshing them.

There's a cool slide here outlining which multi-cloud model works best on different levels of cloud. Going off that slide and going through your use cases, you can measure how much 'tech debt' you have here.

## Lean management

Flow and flow metrics:

- Flow optimisation over resource use.
- Avoid time thieves.
  - Too much WIP
  - Unknown dependencies
  - Unplanned work
  - Conflicting priorities
  - Neglected work (tech debt)
- Visual management

"Team Topologies and Interaction Modes" (it's a book, have a look).

- X-as-a-service
- Collaboration
- Facilitating

Inverse conway manoeuvre

- Team structures affects architecture.
- Have long lived teams to make them actually form well.

Red hat helps with this stuff too - they can come in, and help analyse and improve your culture.

## Culture and Work Management

Culture is to a group as a personality is to an individual.

It is expressed and witnessed in behaviour - you can't have an "open door culture" if the bosses are always in their rooms with the doors closed.

Ron Westrum's PHD was around this. Culture affects information flow (and co-operation, and novelty of ideas). These things are good and important.

Red Hat does a culture assessment too.

"Open Leadership in Open Organisations" is an Open Source book which is recommended in this space. Summarised:

- Have an activated and actionable mission statement
- Understand the difference between moral and engagement
- You should have a meritocracy of ideas: best ideas should win, leaders should emerge
- Avoid being terminally nice in meetings. Truth should come out in the meeting, not in behind-back-gossip in the hallway
- We don't need quicker decision making, but we do need inclusive decisions, which quicker change once the decision is made
- Complex, fast moving works are not suitable for top-down
