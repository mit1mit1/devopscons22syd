# Elevating DevSecOps and Software Delivery with Value Stream Management - Ram Sankaralingam, Chief Technologist of Micro Focus, and Michael Snowden, Pre-Sales AppSec Engineer at Micro Focus

What brings you to DevOps talks? Food, networking drinks, desserts, long cruise dinner?

Okay, what makes your business sponsor you to go? Well, DevOps accelerates business revenue (by up to 4x according to the state of devops report).

DevOps is all about value creation and optimisation. Too much time wasted is a killer. And too much time is wasted in the waterfall method.

"A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life." - Charles Darwin

How can we help you accelerate the delivery, speed up the process?

## Why value stream management

63% of CIO's are reported unsuccessful in demonstrating their IT department's business value (Gartner). They predict that successful communicators here will maintain 60% higher funding.

Siloed tools sprawl is a thing: jira, alm, vscode, JetBrains, ....

Value Stream Management (VSM) can measure IT's business value, fix misalignment to business goals, provide visibility and governance, avoid time waste and waiting, and help balance speed vs. security/quality.

Do things always go as planned? Obviously not, unexpected stuff comes in.

Value stream is the flow of steps from idea to valuable product. VSM is the step on top of that, governing that flow.

Manual Value Stream Mapping is where you write up on a whiteboard the process of developing something, and think through what can be improved. But it's not scalable at enterprise level, which is why we want a platform to do this.

## Elevating DevSecOps to the next level with VSM

VSM can integrate tools and consolidate into a data lake - get stuff from planning tools, dev tools, CI tools, etc.

You get cycle time, lead time, throughput, WIP, all out of the box because it is tracking from the start to the end.

You get visibility and traceability across the whole development process.

## Balancing Speed vs Security

What is DevSecOps?

You google DevOps, you get the classic sideways figure 8 - but normally, security isn't there. So you google DevSecOps, you can a interconnected chain diagram.

Why care?

Most businesses today are building more smaller applications faster, but faster innovation increases risk. Consequentially, over 79% of web apps have critical or security vulnerability - other big numbers for phone apps, ...

The cost of data breach by country or region is pretty big - millions on average.

Security doesn't make money - it doesn't add value, or features, or even performance normally. It's a cost - it's like insurance.

Having good DevSecOps should reduce security expenses, get compliance sorted, and get ahead of the curve.

## Challenges with app security:

- Normally the people doing it are devs, not security experts. They don't know exactly what to look for, and can't combine security with performance easily. E.g. Making a form that is both secure and functional is hard.
- A robust strategy for DevSecOps which makes sure things are scalable is needed, so your organisation can stay on top of security as it grows.

Enabling app security will be a change. You won't have a true end state. You'll need to change your people's training, and your tooling.

Prep steps:
- understand scope
- know how much money you can spend
- know how much of your employee's time and effort you can spend.

Types of Application Security testing you can do (there's more, google them):

- Static analysis (SAST)
- Dynamic analysis (DAST)
- Open source analysis (OSA)

All of these can go on premise, on cloud or on hybrid.

You can fit static and open source analysis into the 'verify' step of DevOps.

Dynamic analysis goes into the 'deployed' step.

Static analysis and dynamic analysis can be explained using an analogy to plumbing.

SAST is like analysing the plumbing schematic. It goes over the schematics and looks for possible bad things. No data is sent, your application is not actually run.

DAST is like turning on the water, and analysing the water than comes out. It can't look inside the application, and has no idea how data is flowing inside it.

Come find us later, MicroFocus has solutions that can play in both of these areas.
