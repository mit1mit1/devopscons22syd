# Whatâ€™s new in DevOps? Updates from the DORA research program - David Stanke, Developer Advocate of Google

I'm here from DORA on a journey of science.

Root of what DORA does is predictive analysis. They study prediction: not causation, but stronger than correlation.

Speed metrics: deploy frequency, lead times for change.

Stability metrics: time to repair, change failure logs

Reliability metric

Capabilities are used to predict metrics; metrics are used to predict business outcomes.

There are more elite performers today than there used to be, and they're faster than they used to be - and they're waaay faster than low performers. Thousands of times faster, three times less likely to fail. How?

Go to the DORA website to get a full insight on the capabilities. But for now, some deep dives

## Multi-cloud

Companies have figured out what the cloud is good for them for, and are taking advantage of it.

Of course, just because you have a cloud doesn't mean you're using it well. NIST has 5 benchmarks for it being done well.

Self service on demand, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, .... People are taking advantage of these more. Moreover, the more of these you use, the more your cloud usage is predictive of success.

## Docs

Quality documentation is predictive of 2-3x more likely reliability.

## Excelling at SRE

This makes organisations 1.8x more likely to meet or exceed organisation goals.

Similar with security and shifting security left - 1.6x gains.

## Culture

What factors contribute? A Westrom generative culture that optimises for information flow, trust, innovation and risk-sharing is predictive of high performance. Moreover, teams with this culture were half as likely to burnout during this pandemic. We see that this culture, practicing trust and blamelessness and showing exchange of information will protect us against the next crisis, whatever it be.

## For more info

Next report out next week, we have got some new deep dives. There are surprises! Science can say unexpected stuff sometimes.

Change is hard. You don't need to do it all at once - actually, data says that doesn't work, you've gotta do it grassroots and slow.

Some companies say "we tried DevOps, it didn't work". They inevitably then say some guy came in, told them to do DevOps, they set up CI for a month then turned it off.

See https://g.co/devops for the report, and self-assessment tools, and a capability catalog.
