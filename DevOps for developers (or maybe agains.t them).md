# DevOps for developers (or maybe against them?!) - Baruch Sadogursky, Head of DevOps Advocacy of Jfrog

DevOps is a ploy of Ops people to get developers to do their job.

(Insert hilarious spiel)

- Developers know how to write code.
- Ops people know how to deploy code.
- Security know how to secure code.

No-one can have depth and breadth. Soâ€¦

DevOps is not about just one of them - it can't be, because none of them have breadth across it.

SRE is when operations becomes a development problem.

We don't need a CatDog. We need operations done in a development way.
